You will have a data frame containing the height (inches) and weight (pounds) of 15 women.**\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nwomen <- women\r\n```\r\n\r\na. Convert height to m and weight into kg using mathematical operations. Do this by creating new variables height_m and weight_kg, rounding both to 2 decimals. Note: 1 inch = 0.0254 m and 1 pound = 0.454 kg.\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nwomen$height_m <- round(women$height*0.0254, 2)\r\nwomen$weight_kg <- round(women$weight*0.454, 2)\r\n```\r\n            \r\n    \r\nb. Calculate BMI from these newly created variables, to 2 decimal places, and then bind this to the women data frame. Note: BMI = weight(kg)/(height(m)^2). Modify this equation to calculate using your variables.\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nwomen$BMI <- round(women$weight_kg/(women$height_m^2), 2)\r\n```\r\n    \r\nc. What is the mean weight in kg among this sample of women?\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nmean(women$weight_kg)\r\n```\r\n\r\nd. How many women have a weight in kg that is less than the mean of this sample?\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nlength(women$weight_kg[women$weight_kg < mean(women$weight_kg)]==TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\ne. Create a new variable called \"BMI_f\" for the BMI factor levels. You will need to use logical operations here. \r\n           \r\n            Low < 18\r\n            Healthy 18 - 24.99\r\n            Overweight 25 - 29.99\r\n            Obese >= 30\r\n            \r\nHow many women are considered healthy in this dataset? \r\n      \r\n```{r}\r\nwomen$BMI_f <- women$BMI\r\nfor (i in 1:nrow(women)){\r\n  if(women$BMI[i] < 18){\r\n      women$BMI_f[i] = \"Low\"\r\n    } else if (women$BMI[i] >= 18 & women$BMI[i] < 25){\r\n      women$BMI_f[i] = \"Healthy\"\r\n    } else if (women$BMI[i] >= 25 & women$BMI[i] < 30){\r\n      women$BMI_f[i] = \"Overweight\"\r\n    } else {\r\n      women$BMI_f[i] = \"Obese\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nlength(women$BMI_f[women$BMI_f == \"Healthy\"]==TRUE)\r\n```\r\n         \r\n\r\n**2. Load the file called `DASS_21.csv` into your R environment. You will have a data frame containing the raw results of DASS-21 questionnaire completed by 10 people.**\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nDASS <- read.csv(\"DASS_21.csv\", header=TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\na. Using the DASS-21 handout, find the Depression score for each individual. What is the average depression score (HINT: use `rowSums` function)?\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nDASS$Dep <- rowSums(DASS[, 2+c(3, 5, 10, 13, 16, 17, 21)])\r\nmean(DASS$Dep)\r\n```\r\n    \r\nb. Find the Anxiety score for each individual. What is the average anxiety score?\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nDASS$Anx <- rowSums(DASS[, 2+c(2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, 20)])\r\nmean(DASS$Anx)\r\n```\r\n    \r\nc. Find the Stress score for each individual. What is the average stress score?\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nDASS$Str <- rowSums(DASS[,2+c(1, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 18)])\r\nmean(DASS$Str)\r\n```\r\n    \r\nd. Find the total DASS score. Find the average for males and females, respectively. (HINT: use a logical function and index)\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nDASS$Total <- rowSums(DASS[,3:24])\r\nmean(DASS$Total[DASS$gender==\"F\"])\r\nmean(DASS$Total[DASS$gender==\"M\"])\r\n```\r\n    \r\ne. Create a boxplot for total DASS in males versus females. Is there a difference? (HINT: use code in workshop)\r\n    \r\n```{r}\r\nboxplot(DASS$Total~DASS$gender, main=\"Total DASS Score by Gender\", names=c(\"Female\", \"Male\"), ylab=\"Total DASS Score\")\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
